🏈 NFL Pro Bowl Prediction

Identifying NFL success from college attributes and draft data

✨ About the Project

This project explores how college-level attributes and draft characteristics translate into long-term NFL success, using Pro Bowl selections as the benchmark for elite performance. Built in Python using Google Colab, the project merges large-scale college and NFL datasets (~2,000 player records) to analyze which factors truly matter when evaluating draft prospects.

Contrary to common belief, physical tools, college statistics, and draft ranking were not strong predictors of Pro Bowl success. Instead, the analysis revealed that age at draft time is the single most statistically significant factor across positions.

🎯 Objective

Answer one core question:

What characteristics best predict whether a college athlete will become an NFL Pro Bowl player?

✅ Key Features

Merged college + NFL datasets from GitHub and Kaggle

Built data pipelines for cleaning and joining multi-source data

Performed feature engineering across 20+ player attributes

Grouped 22 NFL positions into role-based clusters

Applied statistical modeling with 95% confidence intervals

Conducted position-specific correlation analysis

Visualized trends using scatter plots and coefficient charts

🧠 Key Findings

Age at draft time (21–23) is the strongest predictor of Pro Bowl success

Draft rank and physical tools showed no statistically significant impact

Certain positions (WR, Secondary) showed lower Pro Bowl likelihood

Special teams and quarterbacks showed higher relative success rates

Drafting younger players maximizes career longevity and elite outcomes

📊 Methods Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Statistical regression modeling

Correlation analysis

Confidence interval estimation

Position-based clustering

🧪 Data Sources

🔮 Why This Matters

NFL teams invest millions in scouting, yet most early draft picks fail to meet expectations. This project demonstrates that simpler, data-driven decisions — especially prioritizing younger prospects — can outperform traditional scouting assumptions.
